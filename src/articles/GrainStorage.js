        <h2>Farm Practices That Will Take Grain Storage to a New Level</h2>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          There are numerous varieties of crops that are grown for human
          consumption throughout the world. Still, grains such as wheat, maize,
          rice, sorghum, and barley play a major role in the human diet and
          represent the main source of income for the vast majority of farmers.
          The demand for grains is stable throughout the year. However, grain
          production is seasonal, and in many regions, there is only one harvest
          per year. Therefore, once the grains reach their maturity, everything
          else can wait, except the harvest and post-harvest management.
        </p>
        <h3>The Decision That Stands Between Success and Failure</h3>
        <p>
          From the moment that grains are ready for harvest, what happens next
          will determine a farmer’s success or failure. In other words, farmers
          are faced with one big decision: whether to sell the grains as soon as
          possible or to store them and wait for the best market price.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, grain prices are seasonally lower in the time of harvest.
          Though, it’s not surprising that many farmers prefer to store their
          crops and wait for the best market price. But still, storage has its
          own risks as well. Suitable storage facilities bring additional costs,
          and if not managed properly, grains may soon deteoriate and lose their
          quality. Besides that, the market price is always unpredictable and
          the longer the crops stay in storage, the greater the risk.
        </p>
        <h3>Practices That Will Determine the Success of Grain Storage</h3>
        <p>
          Many farmers wonder how to improve storage management and preserve the
          yield. Storing the grains into permanent structures, such as silos or
          bins instead of temporary storages, is definitely a good beginning.
          Now, let’s focus on practices that will ensure proper grain storage:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h4>Preparation of grain silos or bins</h4>
            <p>
              The first step before storing the grains into the silos or bins is
              to make sure that the storage is ready for new grains. In this
              purpose, farmers have to remove any grain left from the previous
              harvest and thoroughly clean their silos or bins. In case of
              insect pest or disease infestation from the previous season, best
              practices recommend spraying with suitable chemicals and cleaning
              the storage in detail.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Storing quality and healthy grains</h4>
            <p>
              It’s extremely important to check harvested grains for the
              presence of insect pests or diseases. Proper sanitation practices
              will prevent the occurrence of pests. However, in case an
              infection still occurs, best practices recommend treating the
              grains with appropriate pesticides in order to prevent the
              infection from spreading onto healthy grains.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Drying, aeration, and temperature control</h4>
            <p>
              The moisture content is one of the burning factors that will
              determine how long the grain can remain in storage without loosing
              its quality. Therefore, grains should be dryed additionaly, in
              order to reach the proper moisture content, depending on the
              requirements and production purpose of each crop, as well as the
              duration of storage. Another important aspect to consider is the
              temperature of stored grains and the storage itself. It’s
              extremely important to monitor grain temperature and to keep
              grains cool and dry.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regular aeration will help maintain a fairly uniform grain
              temperature throughout the storage. Generally, high grain moisture
              and high temperatures are favorable for insect or fungal
              infections, and grain detoriation. However, grains can be stored
              with a higher moisture content if the temperatures are lower.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Regular monitoring</h4>
            <p>
              Regular monitoring of stored grains and storage conditions is just
              as important as the establishment for achieving adequate storage
              conditions. According to this, every successful farmer will check
              silos or bins on a regular basis. Consequently, a farmer will be
              able to detect any changes in temperature or the presence of
              insect pest or disease infestation and handle it on time.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          By following the aforementioned practices, farmers will minimize
          potential storage risks and preserve the quality of their grains until
          the market price is high enough to sell the goods. Regardless of how
          the storage seems complicated and hard to manage, farmers just have to
          take into consideration various demands their crops require and
          carefully manage each storage practice.
