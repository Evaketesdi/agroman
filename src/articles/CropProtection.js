      <h2>Best Practices for Pest Management in Organic Farm Production</h2>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        Organic farming relies on methods which combine scientific knowledge of
        ecology and modern technology with traditional farming practices based
        on naturally occurring biological processes. It is a farming system that
        sustains the health of soils, ecosystems and people. The principal
        methods of organic farming include crop rotation, green manure and
        compost, mechanical cultivation and biological pest control.Farmers are
        faced with myriad of production challenges where the most common
        problems are pests, which include insects, diseases, and weeds. They
        integrate cultural, biological, mechanical, physical and chemical
        practices to manage pests.

          <h3>Cultural practices </h3>
          <p>
            rely on a strategy to make the crop or habitat unacceptable to pests
            by interfering with their oviposition preferences, host plant
            discrimination or location by both adults and immatures. Those can
            be achieved with practices such as crop isolation, mixed cropping,
            and crop rotation. The timing of sowing and planting can be used to
            allow young plants to establish to a tolerant stage before an attack
            occurs and to reduce the susceptible period of attack. Management of
            trap and nursery crops and surrounding environment is also included
            to divert insect attack away from the crop.

          <h3>Mechanical and physical control </h3>
          <p>
            include tillage, mowing, cutting, mulching and organic soil coverage
            and barriers. Tillage turning the soil between crops to incorporate
            crop residues and soil amendments. It also destroys weeds and
            disrupts pest life cycle.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Biological control </h3>
          <p>
            biological control in organic plant protection is a method of
            controlling insect pests and diseases using other organisms which
            rely on predation, parasitism and herbivory, or some other natural
            mechanisms with active farmer’s management interaction. Natural
            enemies of insect pests, known as biological control agents, are
            predators, parasitoids and pathogens. For weeds biological control,
            agents are seed predators, herbivores and plant pathogens, while for
            plant diseases biological agents are antagonists. In organic
            farming, biological agents can be imported to locations where they
            don’t naturally occur, or farmers can make a supplemental release of
            natural enemies, boosting the naturally occurring population.

          <h3>Chemical control </h3>
          <p>
            organic standards are designed to allow the use of naturally
            occurring substances such as pyrethrin and rotenone. Farmers avoid
            the use of broad-spectrum synthetic pesticides, which severely
            disrupt natural control and promote the occurrence of secondary
            pests such as spider mites, brown planthoppers and Rhizoctonia.
            There are also few synthetic substances allowed in organic farming,
            such as fixed coppers (copper hydroxide, copper oxide, copper
            oxychloride, copper sulfate), hydrated lime, hydrogen peroxide, lime
            sulfur, and potassium bicarbonate.
