      <h2>3 Ways Pest Contribute to Plummeting Crop Yields</h2>
      <p>
        COVID-19 pandemic is already causing debilitating effects in virtually
        every industry of the global economy. Unfortunately, the agricultural
        sector is no exception and hasn’t been left unscathed.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those who don’t identify as agriculture workers, the pandemic poses
        a significant threat to food security, especially in economies where the
        agriculture model is labor-intensive. Travel restrictions are hindering
        the mobility of labor and disrupting labor-dependent production as
        active cases skyrocket.
      </p>
      <p>
        In light of these changes, preserving usable crops is all the more
        critical for struggling farmers. Those in the agriculture sector need to
        search for pest control companies specializing in agricultural pest
        control services. Otherwise, these pests will continue to harm
        vulnerable local farming communities.
      </p>
      <h3>Effects of pests on crops</h3>
      <p>
        Pest species, including insects, rodents, and birds, can wreak havoc on
        farmers’ crops. To mitigate damage and remain competitive, consider
        pursuing professional pest control services.
      </p>
      <h4>Crop damage</h4>
      <p>
        Pests can cause devastating effects on crops. How so? For one, these
        insects and rodents feast on the crops’ leaves, fruits, and roots,
        leading to the eventual death of your profit-yielding produce. Insects
        (like aphids) can also transmit harmful bacteria, fungi, or viral
        infections to your crops, resulting in comparable damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at rodents specifically, these scurrying rats and mice can cause
        untold damage to your crops, especially during the harvest season. Other
        rodents like moles feed on the plant’s roots causing substantial
        physical damage and skewing agriculture industry leaders’ crop yields.
      </p>
      <h4>Damage to finished products</h4>
      <p>
        Pest species like weevils, rats, and mice don’t discriminate when
        hunting for food sources. Much like these rodents target sprouting
        crops, they similarly flock to finished products stored for sale or
        consumption. Other insects like moths and beetles can contaminate food,
        making it unfit for human consumption.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re struggling to tell whether your finished products are under
        siege, keep your eyes peeled for holes in grains, insects’ tracks in the
        floury dust, fecal deposits, and webbing produced by larvae of moths.
        Typically, grains become warmer when infected, resulting in damp, moldy
        grains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rodents invade barns, sacks, and other storage areas to gnaw on grains
        and other nearby food sources. As if that’s not enough, these outdoor
        pests will urinate on your foodstuff, which can lead to the
        contamination of grains. Furthermore, rodents are well-known for
        carrying diseases and bacteria. If farm owners don’t neutralize the
        threat in ample time, they can leave a trail of damage by contaminating
        foodstuff and surfaces they scamper across.
      </p>
      <h4>Equipment and machinery damage</h4>
      <p>
        Rodents (particularly rats and mice) can inflict structural damage to
        farm buildings and equipment. Using their ever-growing teeth, rodents
        gnaw at wood, concrete, electrical wires, and even metal, rendering farm
        equipment immobile or unusable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Damaged equipment leads to stoppages in production, which affects
        productivity. Following this trail of destruction, inhibited
        productivity can cause agricultural industry leaders to lag behind their
        competitors.
